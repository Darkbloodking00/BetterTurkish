insane_letter									Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n\nHere’s some important guidelines to ensure you are prepared with the appropriate facilities and staff in order to take proper care of Criminally Insane inmates.\n\n1.  Criminally Insane inmates must have Padded Cells. You can transform standard cells into padded cells (via the Rooms menu). Once you have padded cells you’ll be able to accept your first batch of inmates.\n\n2.  Make sure you have Psychiatrists and Orderly staff members on your payroll. Psychiatrists will also require a special office.\n\n3.  Set up some Psychiatric Consultation programs for your Criminally Insane inmates. These one to one sessions with a Psychiatrist (and padded cells), help to keep the inmates under control. Upgrading the Psychiatrist’s office will also improve their treatment ability.\n\n4.  Left untreated and unchecked, a Criminally Insane inmate may exhibit unpredictable behaviours, attempt to break out, or turn violent.\n\n5.  Orderlies will help escort and heal, and they do not suppress inmates like regular guards. You’ll also need Orderlies to fit your Psychopathic Criminally Insane Inmates with straitjackets at the day’s end. \n\n6.  Criminally Insane inmates mixing with others can sometimes lead to trouble. It's a good idea to build and segregate Criminally Insane sectors to Canteens, Yards and other areas. And you may wish to have the Psychiatrist’s offices near your Criminally Insane cell blocks.\n\n7.  Finally, inmates from other security levels now have a chance to become criminally insane, so keep an eye out\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp

codex_tooltip_prisonerTransfer			Prisoner Transfers allows you to set criteria that inmates must meet in order to be transferred and upgraded into a nicer security sector within your prison, one that may offer more comfort, facilities and other privileges. \n\nInmates will now evaluate their current sector’s conditions and those of the sector below their’s, and decide if they like to be transferred. If so, they will then determine whether they will try to improve their behaviour and meet your transfer policy, based on their own needs and characteristics.\n\nEach sector is graded, based on the privileges and facilities you offer to inmates in that sector. The bigger the ‘difference’ between their sector and the one below, the more prisoners will want to be transferred overall.\n\nAfter a prisoner meets your transfer criteria, it's still up to you whether and when to transfer them.

objective_ReadSandALetter						Letter from the CEO (Island Bound)
island_letter									Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n\nWelcome to your new life as an Island Bound Prison Architect! Here’s some tips to get you started with docks, helipads and island prisons.\n\n1. Islands - Depending on the prison's circumstances, you may have no physical link to the mainland, and if so you will need BOATS and HELICOPTERS to provide your transportation services. Build Boat DOCKS and HELIPADS, and determine their purposes; to receive specific deliveries, new prisoners, or new emergencies units and more, by sea and air. -Make sure docks are built with a clear shipping lane for boats to come and go. -Special FERRY DOCKS can be built to link islands together, as well as BRIDGES and STEPPING STONES. -Your prison can now be better protected with new ELITE OPS units, and helicopters that can fight fires from the air.\n\n2. Customising Deliveries and Transports - Via LOGISTICS, you can customise which services are assigned to each dock, helipad and the road, allowing your prison's efficiency to increase. Docks and Helipads can be linked to additional Delivery, Reception and Export zones. This will allow you to have food supplies delivered closer to the Kitchen, or new Max Sec inmates brought in closer to the Max Sec wing on your island, for example. The possibilities are endless!\n\n3. Landscaping - Water can be placed to create moats or oceans around your prison, and land can be shaped with shorelines, using dirt and other flooring types. Any land or smaller islands created in water, will be created immediately.\n\n4. New Security Measures - Contraband can still arrive via boats and helicopters, so we’re also providing you with some new state-of-the-art equipment; -Build SCANNER MACHINES in Delivery and Storage areas to check crates and boxes. You’ll need an alert guard to watch on a connected SCANNER MONITOR. -Assign guards to CHECKPOINTS to pat-down all prisoners and visitors passing through. This is a great way to discover contraband, but can reduce the flow of prisoners if not placed strategically.\n\nFinally, even islands aren’t escape-proof, so it could be a good idea to erect Sniper Towers on your shorelines, to keep an eye out for ‘swimmers’.\n\nThat's about everything - good luck!\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_1       The Room Quality view shows you the quality rating of all upgrade-able rooms in your prison. The higher the number, the better the quality. Mousing over a room will show you the factors that went into determining it's quality, and what you can add to increase that quality.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_2		With PRISONER TRANSFERS turned ON
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_3		- Room quality will also contribute to an overall grade for that Security Sector. 
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_4		- Prisoners will desire to be transferred to a lower Security Sector, if it is better (has a higher grade) than their current Security Sector.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_5       CELL GRADING
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_6       - Prisoners are entitled to a higher quality cell for good behaviour over time. Having higher quality cells available is a good way to incentivise good behaviour.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_7       - It's important to keep some low quality cells in your prison, as new arrivals to your prison will need somewhere to go, and if all the available cells are too high quality they might find themselves in a holding cell.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_8       - Prisoners can be placed in a higher quality cell than they deserve if there is no other space available, but it might make the other prisoners unhappy...
