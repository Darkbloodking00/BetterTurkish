Mousing over a room will show you the factors that went into determining it's quality, and what you can add to increase that quality.\n\n

buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_3		- Room quality will also contribute to an overall grade for that Security Sector. 
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_4		- Prisoners will desire to be transferred to a lower Security Sector, if it is better (has a higher grade) than their current Security Sector.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_5       CELL GRADING
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_6       - Prisoners are entitled to a higher quality cell for good behaviour over time. Having higher quality cells available is a good way to incentivise good behaviour.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_7       - It's important to keep some low quality cells in your prison, as new arrivals to your prison will need somewhere to go, and if all the available cells are too high quality they might find themselves in a holding cell.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_8       - Prisoners can be placed in a higher quality cell than they deserve if there is no other space available, but it might make the other prisoners unhappy...

buildtoolbar_popup_help_jobs_4              - Some jobs, such as working in the kitchen or workshop, require the prison to have passed a training course first. You can run these courses from the Programs tab of your report window.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_jobs_5              - Working prisoners are paid a small amount for every hour that they work. Allocating the maximum number of jobs might not necessarily be the best idea; prisoners still get paid even if there is nothing for them to do.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_1           The Dangers view shows which contraband a prisoner can steal from each of the rooms in your prison. Additionally, you can see the supply and demand of each type of contraband to the right. If the demand of a specific type of contraband is higher than the supply, a prisoner is more likely to try and steal it, especially if they are in desperate need of something themselves.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_2           ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_3           - Not all rooms that are sources of contraband need to be accessed by prisoners, and their access to those rooms can be restricted or blocked entirely.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_4           - While this shows you which rooms in your prison contraband can be stolen from, rooms aren't the only way for prisoners to get what they need...

buildtoolbar_popup_help_contraband_2        ~Mouse over a specific piece of contraband to see its history, including how it was originally acquired by the prisoner and where it went before it was found.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_contraband_3        ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_contraband_4        - If you are finding that a lot of contraband is coming from a relatively small number of places, it might be time to beef up security in those areas.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_contraband_5        - Different types of contraband are detected in different ways. Guard Dogs, for example, as very good at detecting things that have a strong smell to them.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_3         ~When connecting items using wires (e.g., a CCTV Monitor to a CCTV Camera), Left Click the first object, and then Left Click the object you want to connect. Holding down Shift will let you connect multiple objects.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_4         ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_5         - Small electrical items, like lights and TVs, will automatically connect to power as long as an electrical cable is nearby. Larger items, such as Laundry Machines or Water Pumps, will need to be connected directly to the cable.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_6         - Large water pipes can carry water over a long distance, but smaller pipes have a shorter range. Having a single large pipe leading to a building or area, and connecting individual objects using smaller pipes, is a good way to save money.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_7         - The Utilities view can have a lot going on, especially in larger prisons. Clicking on a specific object will highlight the related connects much more clearly, making it easier to see. For example, clicking electrical cables will make all electrical cables and objects in your prison much clearer.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_8         - If you have multiple Power Stations in your prison, they will need to have their own separate Electrical Cables. If Electrical Cables connected to 2 separate Power Stations come in contact, both stations will shut down.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_guard_3             ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_guard_4             - Guards can find escape tunnels by searching toilets in Cells. If the toilet is searched specifically, they will find any escape tunnels without fail.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_guard_5             - If you have a Security Chief, you can see how many idle Guards you have on the information bar at the top of the screen. If you frequently have 0 Guards available, it might be an indication that you don't have enough guards to keep up with their current workload.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_workman_1           Workmen are the people who build your prison, help unload deliveries and, in some cases, bring those deliveries to the various areas of your prison.\n\n

buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_1        Armed Guards are used to keep especially dangerous or unruly prisoners in line, carrying a shotgun with them at all times. They Suppress all nearby Prisoners making them much less likely to cause trouble, and if their life is threatened they will use their shotgun, which will usually make all other nearby prisoners stop causing trouble.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_2        ~With an Armed Guard selected, you can order them to move anywhere in your prison by Right Clicking that location. \n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_3        ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_4        - If the Freefire button is activated, Armed Guards will not wait until their life is in danger before using their shotgun. They will just open fire on any prisoners causing trouble.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_accessonly_5	- Access-Only is not a strict setting. It does not explicitly prevent people from entering, especially if their target is inside the marked area. If passing through an Access-Only area is significantly shorter than an alternative (for example, navigating around the entire of the prison), people may still pass through Access-Only zones.

researchtooltip_security                Unlocks the Chief of Security, who can be hired from the staff toolbar.  The chief gives you access to the Deployment screen, and will also give you a realtime report of the danger level of your prison, often predicting future trouble.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_maintenance             Unlocks the Foreman.  Hire him from the Staff toolbar.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_legal                   Unlocks the Lawyer, who can be hired from the Staff toolbar. Unlocks a number of research options to give you greater control over your prison.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.

researchtooltip_dogs                    Unlocks the Dog Handler and Guard Dog.  They excel in sniffing out the smelly contraband in your prison, and detecting escape tunnels.\n\nDogs are also very fast which allows them to chase prisoners with ease. 
researchtooltip_cctv                    Unlocks CCtv cameras and security monitors.  Use these to keep watch on unmanned parts of your prison.\n\nAlso unlocks the Phone Tap system, which allows you to listen in on prisoner phone calls and gain vital intelligence.

researchtooltip_riotguards              (CURRENTLY SERVES NO PURPOSE)\nUnlocks the Riot Guard.  These guys are armoured and better able to deal with violent situations.
researchtooltip_maintainance            Unlocks the Foreman.  He allows you to do further research on things like Prison Labour, or additional staff members like the Gardener.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_clone                   Unlocks the clone tool on the main toolbar.  Use this tool to rapidly duplicate areas of your prison, such as Cells.  To use, select a zone to be copied with a right mouse drag, then left click to stamp down a copy.

researchtooltip_finance                 Unlocks the Accountant, which gives access to the financial report for your Prison.\n\nAlso allows you to spend more each day than your income would normally allow, assuming you have the funds in reserve.\n\nLike all Administrators, she requires an office to work.  
researchtooltip_landexpansion           Authorises you to purchase neighbouring plots of land, and thereby expand the size of your prison beyond its initial bounds.
researchtooltip_prisonlabour            Allows you to put your prisoners to work around your prison (Cooking, Cleaning etc), saving you on staff wages, earning you money, and teaching your prisoners new skills at the same time.\n\nAlso Unlocks the Workshop and the Laundry.
researchtooltip_education               Unlocks the ability to run educational reform programs for your prisoners, using externally hired teachers. 
researchtooltip_contraband              Training for your Guards to become better at tracking and recovering contraband. Unlocks the contraband Supply and Demand report, the Contraband overlay (showing all possible theft locations within your prison), and tracks all recovered contraband back to where it was smuggled or stolen.\n\nAlso unlocks the ability to recruit prisoners as Confidential Informants.\n\nAlso unlocks the gang intelligence view.
researchtooltip_policy                  Unlocks the Policy Report, allowing you to increase and decrease the punishments for all types of misconduct, as well as automatically triggering searches of the misbehaving prisoner and their cell.\n\nAlso allows you to control the nutritional policy, changing the quantity and variety of food served to prisoners. 
researchtooltip_armoury                 Unlocks the armoury room, and allows you to deploy armed guards throughout your prison.
researchtooltip_bodyarmour              Equips all your Guards, Armed Guards and Dog Handlers with body armour. This can help absorb damage during a fight, but your guards will move slower.\n\nGuards must visit the armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for all body armour purchased this way.
researchtooltip_tazers                  Allows your Armed Guards to carry Tazers, a potent single-shot weapon that will render most targets unconscious instantly. Tazers can only be fired once before they need a full hour to recharge.\n\nArmed Guards must visit the armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for every tazer purchased this way.
researchtooltip_tazersforeveryone       Extends the Tazer program so that your regular Guards may also carry Tazers for defense.\n\nThey must visit the Armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for every tazer purchased this way.
researchtooltip_bankloans               Allows you to borrow large lump sums of money from the bank, in exchange for a daily payment of interest. Paying off your loans will increase your credit rating and allow you to borrow larger sums later.
researchtooltip_lowertaxes1             Takes advantage of government tax incentives and reduces your effective Corporation Tax rate to just 15%.\n\nYou will save $1,500 taxes per $10,000 of daily profit.
researchtooltip_lowertaxes2             Your accountant stretches the rules to breaking point, and moves all your official accounts and business processes to a foreign country with highly preferential tax rates. Your effective Corporation tax liability will drop to around 1%.\n\nYou will save a total of $3,000 taxes per $10,000 of daily profit.
researchtooltip_extragrant              Enables you to accept up to three grants simultaneously instead of two.
researchtooltip_advancedmanagement      Gives you the tools to micro manage aspects of your prison so they meet your exact requirements.\n\nUnlocks Food logistics, allowing you to specify which kitchens cook for which canteens, and which canteens inmates eat in.  Similarly, Laundry logistics lets you override which cell blocks are covered by which laundries.\n\nAlso unlocks the Deployment Scheduler, which lets you customise your guard deployment at different times of day.\n\nUnlocks the Reform Program Scheduler, letting you manually override the daily schedule of programs.
researchtooltip_permanentpunishment     Sometimes being in Prison just isn't locked away enough. Your lawyer can file the necessary papers to let you confine prisoners to a cell, permanently. 
researchtooltip_removemincellsize       The cells in your prison require a certain amount of space to fit legal requirements. But imagine how many more cells you could fit in if that wasn't the case! Removes the minimum size requirements for standard cells.
researchtooltip_reduceexecutionliability Your lawyer lobbies for a reduction in the required strength of the conviction before death row proceedings can be properly started. Essentially lowers the number of appeals a prisoner gets before you can schedule their execution without liability.
researchtooltip_legalprep               Every prison runs into problems every now and then, and some of them come with fairly big legal consequences. Your lawyer will start the paperwork to help keep the heat off you should something go wrong, but this needs to be done in advance.
researchtooltip_legaldefense            You're in a bad situation - something went terribly wrong and you've been put on notice. If it looks like you aren't going to be able to manage the situation, your lawyer can help get you off the hook. Completing this research will remove any current warnings that might otherwise result in you being fired.
researchtooltip_guardtowers             Unlocks Guard Towers and Snipers, allowing you to have highly trained marksmen keeping an eye on the outdoor areas of your prison.\n\nSnipers will need to visit an armoury to collect a rifle, otherwise they will be unarmed.
researchtooltip_forestrylabour			Allows you to put prisoners to work in the Forestry via the Logistics menu. Foresty area must be enclosed for prisoners to be assigned to work in them, and to prevent escapes. Be aware that prisoners will also require access to Delivery areas in order to replant trees.

research_legaldefense_adviser1          It looks like your lawyer has filed some paperwork that is protecting you from the consequences of this mess. I guess that means I can't fire you. This time.
research_legaldefense_adviser2          Get your prison in order, quickly, and make sure it stays in line. That trick won't work again and it won't protect you forever.

victory_adviserwarning_toomanydeaths1   Yesterday was a very dark chapter in the history of this prison. Far too many people lost their lives here.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanydeaths2   Make sure nobody else dies today, or you will face prosecution for criminal negligence.
victory_advisernotice_toomanydeaths1    Don't say we didn't warn you. You have been found guilty of criminal negligence because of recent events here.
victory_advisernotice_toomanydeaths2    You will now spend the next ten years in prison as punishment for your crime. Your own prison. Good luck.
victory_adviserwarning_riot1            Your prison is out of control. Put down this riot now, or the government will step in and retake the prison by force.
victory_advisernotice_riot1             You have failed to control this riot. The government has revoked our prison contract, and is now sending in the national guard to retake the prison.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanyescapes1  We have a PR disaster brewing here. Far too many prisoners have escaped recently, and it's your fault.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanyescapes2  Lock this place down and make sure nobody else escapes, otherwise the press will expect your head on a platter.
victory_advisernotice_toomanyescapes1   You have failed. This prison is a laughing stock in the media, and they want somebody to blame.
victory_advisernotice_toomanyescapes2   That somebody is you.  You're fired.
victory_adviserwarning_bankrupt1        We are bankrupt! Your disastrous management has led us to financial ruin.
victory_adviserwarning_bankrupt2        Find a way to fix this soon or you will be fired.
victory_advisernotice_bankrupt1         We have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and put the prison into administration. You have failed.
victory_adviserwarning_wardendeaths1    Working for you has become much too hazardous. We're struggling to find wardens who want to work at the prison.
victory_adviserwarning_wardendeaths2    If you let another warden die, we will have no choice but to fire you.
victory_advisernotice_wardendeaths1     You have failed to provide a safe working environment for your wardens. Everyone is afraid to work for you.
victory_advisernotice_wardendeaths2     We have no choice by to let you go. You are fired.
victory_adviserwarning_reoffenders1     A lot of the prisoners you have put up for early release have gone on to commit new crimes. This could cost us if we don't take control of the situation.
victory_adviserwarning_reoffenders2     If too many more prisoners reoffend upon release, you'll be the one to take the blame.
victory_advisernotice_reoffenders1      You have released too many dangerous criminals into the world. We have no choice but let you go. You have failed.
victory_adviserwarning_executions1      This is the second time that you have put an innocent prisoner to death. The public outrage is enormous.
victory_adviserwarning_executions2      If another innocent prisoner is executed, you will be held responsible.
victory_advisernotice_executions1       You have allowed too many innocent people to be executed. We can not longer allow you to run this prison. You have failed.
victory_advisernotice_InnocentsExecuted1 You've just executed someone without following the proper procedure, and it turns out they were innocent. This is a gross  miscarriage of justice, and you are responsible. You're fired, and will probably be jailed yourself.
victory_adviserwarning_staffpayrise1    Our staff have become unhappy with their working conditions in the prison and have threatened to go on strike if they don't get a 50% pay rise.
victory_adviserwarning_staffstrike1     Our staff have gone on strike! They will still be willing to return if they get their 50% pay rise.

score_tooltip_punishment                This is a grading of how well the prisoner has been punished for their crimes, as perceived by the public. Serving a long term in prison is the foundation of a strong punishment, but hard times locked up alone will also count towards it.\n\nKeep in mind that too much reform or free time will be seen as 'soft on crime' and will count against their punishment grade.\n\nA strong punishment score will deter the prisoner from re-offending after release.
score_tooltip_reform                    A grading of how well you have attempted to reform and rehabilitate this prisoner through the use of Reform programs.\n\nA high reform score will give the prisoner a much greater chance of finding genuine employment after release, and will therefore reduce their re-offending chance.\n\nNote: Putting your prisoners to work around the prison also counts towards this.
score_tooltip_health                    A record of the prisoners health and well-being during their stay in your prison. Outdoor exercise and good food count towards this. Injures that go untreated, drugs and alcohol usage all count against it.\n\nA poor score here will increase their chance of re-offending, particularly if the prisoner leaves prison with untreated drug or alcohol dependencies.
score_tooltip_security                  A grading that represents how well you have kept this prisoner safely locked away. Keeping prisoners locked in their cells under armed guard will count heavily towards this. You will be penalised if the prisoner is involved in fights, murders or escape attempts.\n\nA low score indicates the prisoner simply continued their criminal existence once inside your prison, and hence their re-offending chance will be high upon leaving.

score_tooltip_reoffendingchance         An estimate of the prisoners likelihood to re-offend after leaving prison. Many factors are taken into account to produce this value:\n\n- DECREASE Harsh/strong punishment\n- DECREASE Successful reform programs\n- INCREASE Poor health and security\n- INCREASE Untreated drug and alcohol addictions\n- INCREASE Gang membership\n\n\n- The prisoner's age is a major factor.\n- The number of prior convictions is a strong indicator.\n- A large supporting family can help.
score_tooltip_clemencychance_title      Likelihood of Clemency
score_tooltip_clemencychance            The likelihood that the Appeals Board will grant clemency and commute the prisoners death row sentence. Each unsuccessful appeal lowers this value until it is below the State Approved Conviction Strength, at which point full authorisation to proceed is given. Scheduling the execution before this point will result in extreme penalties if it is later found that the prisoner's appeal would have succeeded.\n\nIf clemency is granted, the prisoner will be immediately released (if found innocent), or transferred to Maximum Security (if still judged as guilty.)
score_tooltip_currentchance             The State Approved Conviction Strength is *X%
score_tooltip_clemencywarning           The chance of this prisoner being granted clemency is currently above the State Approved safe level. If you proceed with this execution, you will be held personally responsible if it is later found he would have been granted clemency.

needs_help_bladder                      Everyone needs to use the toilet, even prisoners. Don't forget that most parts of your prison Regime are pretty strict - they can't use the toilet in their cell if they are supposed to be in the shower room, for example.
needs_help_bowels                       Everyone needs to use the toilet, even prisoners. Don't forget that most parts of your prison Regime are pretty strict - they can't use the toilet in their cell if they are supposed to be in the shower room, for example.
needs_help_sleep                        Prisoners require sleep. Prisoners will only be able to sleep in the cell to which they are assigned, and will only sleep between 8pm and 8am. They'll obviously need a bed, too.
needs_help_food                         Everyone needs to eat, and most people need to eat more than once per day. If you find that your Kitchens aren't able to keep up with the demand, try hiring more Cooks or adding more Cookers to your Kitchens. You can also tweak your food policies in the Policies tab of your Report window.
needs_help_safety                       Even in prison, your Prisoners want to feel safe. If there are lots of fights in your prison or the overall danger level is high, prisoners will feel less safe, and may consider arming themselves. If this is becoming a problem, trying increasing the security throughout your prison by hiring more Guards, creating more patrols, or by seeing to the other needs of your Prisoners.
needs_help_hygiene                      Most Prisoners will want to wash regularly, especially in the mornings after they wake up. The Shower regime will force prisoners who don't have their own personal Shower to go to the nearest Shower room. If this is becoming a problem, consider expanding your Shower facilities, or adding more Freetime so Prisoners can shower as they need to.
needs_help_exercise                     Many prisoners will want to be able to keep in shape. You can help them do this by adding a Yard to your prison. Weights Benches, either in the Yard or other common areas, will also help with this.
needs_help_recreation                   A bored Prisoner is a dangerous Prisoner. You can see to a Prisoners need for Recreation by adding pass-times to the common areas of your prison, such as TVs or Radios.
needs_help_comfort                      Prisoners generally want to feel comfortable, physically and emotionally. There are many ways you can aid this, such as allowing for family visitations, giving them hot showers or simply making sure they have somewhere to sit.
needs_help_environment                  Prisoners hate living in dirty conditions, and with a lot of Prisoners using the same facilities, things can get messy pretty quickly. Hire some Janitors or put your Prisoners to work in a Cleaning Cupboard to keep on top of this.
needs_help_privacy                      Sometimes Prisoners will want some time to themselves. Spending time in their cell will usually see to this, but if they are living in a Dormitory with a lot of other prisoners, they might not find much Privacy there.
needs_help_freedom                      Even in prison, your Prisoners will want to feel as if they have some level of Freedom. You can facilitate this by adding some Freetime or Yard time to your Regime.
needs_help_clothing                     Prisoners are going to want clean clothes from time to time, even if it is just the same coloured jumpsuit. Adding a Laundry to your prison and either hiring Janitors or putting Prisoners to work in it will help make this dream a reality.
needs_help_drugs                        Many prisoners have problems with drug addiction - it might even be why they are in prison in the first place. You can help treat this problem by running a Drug Treatment Program in your Infirmary. 
needs_help_alcohol                      Many prisoners struggle with alcoholism, and will go to great lengths to get their hands on some alcohol. You can try to help alleviate this by running Alcoholic Group Therapy sessions.
needs_help_spirituality                 Lots of prisoners have various religious beliefs. You can enable your prisoners' practice of these beliefs by adding Pews or Prayer Mats to your prison, but building a Chapel and running Spiritual Guidance programs will give the best results and generally help calm your prisoners too.
needs_help_literacy                     Some prisoners just want to read. Adding a Library will let those Prisoners borrow books to meet this need.
needs_help_warmth                       No one wants to be cold all the time, but nature doesn't really care about that. Adding radiators to your prison will keep your buildings warm enough to stop this becoming a problem. 
needs_help_babysleep                    Babies need to sleep more than regular prisoners. If any of your Prisoners have a Baby, make sure you have Cots available so that the Baby can sleep as needed.
needs_help_babyplay                     Babies need engagement and entertainment. If any of your Prisoners have a Baby, make sure you have Play Mats in an accessible area.
needs_help_family                       Most Prisoners want to keep in contact with their families in one way or another. The easiest way to let them do this is to add Phones to your prison, though adding a Visitation facility to your prison will be much more effective. A Mail Room can also help with this need.
needs_help_luxuries                     Many Prisoners enjoy a bit of luxury from time to time. You can help them meet this need by building a Shop in your prison, and make a bit of money in the process. Prisoners who meet this need will be less likely to cause trouble, but there's no downside for ignoring it; it IS prison, after all.

needs_help_staffbladder                 Even your Staff will need to use the toilet occassionally. They will do so whenever they are on break.
needs_help_staffbowels                  Even your Staff will need to use the toilet occassionally. They will do so whenever they are on break.
needs_help_stafffood                    Staff need to eat, and will do so in Staff-only Canteens or Staffrooms. Food will be delivered for your staff so that they don't have to eat the same slop as the prisoners.
needs_help_staffsafety                  Even working in a prison, your staff have a right to safety. High danger levels or constant fights will make your staff feel unsafe, though this can be countered somewhat by having better equipped guards.
needs_help_staffrecreation              Your staff spend a lot of time in your prison and will need some entertainment from time to time. TVs or a Radio in the Staffroom are one way to provide this.
needs_help_staffcomfort                 Most of your staff spend the entire day on their feet; occassionally they will want to relax. Giving them somewhere nice to sit while they are on their breaks is a good way to relieve this.
needs_help_staffenvironment             Staff don't want to work in a messy prison anymore than prisoners want to live there. Keeping the prison clean will prevent this from being a problem.
needs_help_staffrest                    Staff need to take breaks during the day, and regain their energy. They prefer to rest in a private staff room with some comfy sofas.
needs_help_staffwarmth                  Staff need to stay warm, add radiators to your prison to make them more comfortable.

regimetooltip_nothing                   Mahkumlar hücrelerinde kilitli kalır. Yaptıkları seçimlerin onları buraya getirmiş olduğunu düşünmek dışında yapacak hiçbir şeyleri yoktur.\n\nUzun sürelere esnetilmiş bir kilitleme en sert mahkumlara bile belirleyici bir ceza olarak kendini kanıtlamıştır.
regimetooltip_sleep                     Mahkumlar hücrelerine kilitlenmiş, ve ışıklar kapalı durumdadır. Herkes uykuya geçer.\n\n Yalnıca şu kaçış tünellerini kazanlar dışında...
regimetooltip_eat                       Mahkumlar en yakın erişime açık yemekhaneye doğru yola koyulur ve öğle yemeği için yerlerine otururlar.\n\n Mahkumlar yemekhanede bulunan her tesisi kullanmak konusunda serbesttir, ancak bu süre zarfında yemekhaneden ayrılmalarına izin verilmez.
regimetooltip_shower                    Mahkumlar banyoya girmek için kıyafetlerini çıkarırlar. Günlük banyo süresi tutukluların hijyeni için gereklidir, ancak bazı mahkumlar onları zorlamadığınız sürece banyo yapmaya zahmet etmeyeceklerdir.
regimetooltip_yard                      Mahkumlar temiz hava, gün ışığı ve egzersiz yapmak için tesisten avluya çıkmalarına izin verilir.\n\nMahkumlar avluda bulunan egersiz sehpası, sevdikleri ile konuşmak için telefon kulübesi ve duş vs gibi tesislerden yararlanabilirler.
regimetooltip_work                      Mahkumlar hapishanede çalıştırılırlar. Açılan her işin yeri doldurulacak ve mahkumlar otomatik olarak çalıştıkları yerlerin konumunu rapor edecekler. (Yeni iş kapılarını Konuşlandırma ekranından ayarlayabilirsiniz.)\n\nAyrıca bütün Reform programları da bu sürede gerçekleşir.  Mahkumlar hiçbir iş veya Reform programına atanmadıysa etrafta 'Boş Zaman' adı altında etrafta dolaşmak konusunda özgürdür.
regimetooltip_freetime                  Mahkumlar hücrelerinden salınmış ve hapishanede bulunan her tesisi kullanmalarına izin verilmiştir. Mahkumlar en fazla bu zamandan hoşlanır ve zamanlarını ihtiyaçlarını en iyi şekilde karşılamak ve sosyalleşmek için geçirirler.\n\n Uzun süreli boş zaman hapishanedeki stres ve gerginliği azaltabilir, ama çoğu kişi bunun güç bela bir cezalandırma olarak görür.
regimetooltip_worklockdown              Mahkumlar hapishanede çalıştırılırlar.  Açılan her işin yeri doldurulacak ve mahkumlar otomatik olarak çalıştıkları yerlerin konumunu rapor edecekler. (Yeni iş kapılarını Konuşlandırma ekranından ayarlayabilirsiniz.)\n\nAyrıca bütün Reform programları da bu sürede gerçekleşir.  Mahkumlar hiçbir iş veya Reform programına atanmadıysa 'Kilitleme' adı altında hücrelerinde kısıtlandırılırlar.

execution_result_ok                     *N zanlısının elektrikli sandalya ile ve şahitlerin gözetimindeki infaz kararı *T bölgesinde belirlendi. Bu süreçteki rölü nedeniyle hapishane $10.000 tazminat ile ödüllendirilmiştir.
execution_result_appealed               The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Regrettably, new information came to light after the fact that would have affected his appeal for clemency, though no action will be taken against the institution and they will receive the standard compensation of $10,000 for their part in the process.
execution_result_innocent               The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Regrettably, evidence was later uncovered that revealed *N's innocence, though no action will be taken against the institution and they will receive the standard compensation of $10,000 for their part in the process.
execution_result_illegal                The execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Due to the failure to follow the legally required appeals process and the discovery of information that would have ultimately resulted in a successful appeal, the institution is fined $50,000. Due to the failure to follow proper protocol, executions are suspended until a later date, and any remaining Death Row prisoners will be transferred to another facility. 
execution_result_illegalinnocent        The illegal execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Due to the failure to follow the legally required appeals process and the fact that *N was innocent of his crimes, the administrator of this facility is terminated from their position, effective immediately. 
execution_warning_one                   Should the next execution performed here not follow the correct procedure, you will be fired from your position.
execution_warning_two                   Due to your past failures to follow correct procedure, one more breach of protocol in this manner will result in you being fired from your position.

ceos_letter                             Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n\nCongratulations on completing your basic induction - you are now a fully qualified Prison Architect!  Soon you'll be designing, building and running your own prisons starting from nothing but an empty plot of land and a few stacks of bricks.  Before you get started, I thought I might share some important lessons with you.\n\n1. Every prison needs a Warden - he should be one of your first hires.  Build him a nice office and he'll open up a whole range of advanced facilities via the bureaucracy system.\n\n2. Individual jail cells are expensive, especially early on when funds are very tight.  Save money by starting with a single large Holding Cell, which can be shared between many prisoners at once.\n\n3. Get your Kitchen and Canteen up and running before the first prisoners show up, and be sure to hire some Cooks - nothing irritates a prisoner more than an empty stomach!\n\n4. Building a prison is an expensive undertaking, and you need to become a master of raising large volumes of money through grants and contracts. You can access these grants through the 'Reports' screens.\n\nThat's about everything - good luck!\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp.

adviser_deathrowintro_3                 İşte biz burada devreye giriyoruz.  Bu elemanın büyük günü için infaz odası inşa etmek üzere sözleşme yaptık.
adviser_deathrowintrob_1                İşte burası yeni tesisin kurulmasını istediğim yer.
adviser_deathrowintrob_2                Her projede olduğu gibi bu projede de ilk yapmamız gereken adım yapının kendisini inşa etmek - ve tabii ki infaz odası ve nezarethane için yeterli boşluk da.
adviser_deathrowintrob_3                O zaman hadi başlayalım.  Buraya yeni bir yapı inşa et.

adviser_deathrow_explain1               Your Workmen are responsible for the construction of buildings.
adviser_deathrow_explain2               They'll collect the steel and concrete from this store room and take it to the construction site.
adviser_deathrow_explain3               They'll use those raw materials to build the foundations and framework of your new building.
adviser_deathrow_explain4               This is the slowest part of construction, so you should plan ahead when building new facilities.
adviser_deathrow_explain5               While we wait, take a look around.  Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around, and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

objective_deathrow_building             Construct a building to house the Execution Facility

adviser_deathrow_buildinside1           We will also need an entrance to the new Execution Facility.
adviser_deathrow_buildinside2           Build a Large Jail Door into the south wall.

objective_deathrow_buildouterdoor       Build a Large Jail Door entrance

adviser_deathrow_internalwalls1          Inside the building I want a Cell and an Execution Room.
adviser_deathrow_internalwalls2          Partition the space by constructing some Brick Walls.

objective_deathrow_buildinternalwalls   Build internal walls

adviser_deathrow_internaldoors1          Now add Large Jail Doors to those dividing walls.
adviser_deathrow_internaldoors2          You can rotate an object before placement by clicking the middle mouse button (or press R).

objective_deathrow_buildinternaldoors   Build internal doors (Middle Click or press R to rotate an object)

adviser_deathrow_designation1           That's looking good.  We now need to designate Rooms within those spaces.
adviser_deathrow_designation2           Designate a Cell in the smaller area where our condemned inmate will live.
adviser_deathrow_designation3           Then designate the Execution Room itself in the larger area.

objective_deathrow_designatecell        Designate a Cell
objective_deathrow_designateexecution   Designate an Execution Room

adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements1      Those new Rooms have requirements before they become functional.  
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements2      The Cell needs a Bed and a Toilet.
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements3      The Execution Room requires the Electric Chair.

objective_deathrow_cellobjects1         Build a Bed
objective_deathrow_cellobjects2         Build a Toilet
objective_deathrow_executionobjects     Build an Electric Chair

adviser_deathrow_optional1              That's the essentials taken care of.  But there are still a few improvements you could make.
adviser_deathrow_optional2              It's up to you though, these aren't strictly required.  It depends how much you care about your prisoners and their environment.
adviser_deathrow_optional3              The Cell itself could be improved with an outward facing Window, and a small Bookshelf.  
adviser_deathrow_optional4              And the facility would look better with a higher quality floor material - like Wooden Floorboards or Mosaic Tiles.
adviser_deathrow_optional5              Outside you could add some lighting, and a paved pathway if you think it needs it.

adviser_deathrow_transfer05             This is the man in question, Edward Romsey.  A teacher once, would you believe.
adviser_deathrow_transfer06             It's not our place to decide if he deserves this.  The Law has made that decision.  We're just here to do a job.
adviser_deathrow_transfer1              Once you are satisfied the facility is ready, you can begin the Prisoner Transfer to his new cell.
adviser_deathrow_transfer2              Simply click on the polaroid in his cell to initiate the transfer.

objective_deathrow_path                 (OPTIONAL) Build a Path to the new facility
objective_deathrow_window               (OPTIONAL) Add a Window to the Cell
objective_deathrow_bookshelf            (OPTIONAL) Add a Bookshelf to the Cell
objective_deathrow_flooring             (OPTIONAL) Redo the flooring with higher quality materials
objective_deathrow_outerlights          (OPTIONAL) Create some outdoor lighting around the facility
objective_deathrow_transferinmate       When you are done, begin the Prisoner Transfer by clicking on the polaroid in Edward's cell.

adviser_deathrow_setupmurder1           Don't shed one tear for this guy.  He's a stone cold killer, guilty as charged. 
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder2           He even confessed.  Wanna hear his description of what he did?  
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder3           It's juicy stuff.  "It was around 11pm.  The lights were already on.  I knew she was home..."
adviser_deathrow_postmurder1            Like I said, a stone cold killer.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder2            Clear as day if you ask me.  Deserves every volt he's gonna get.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder3            All men deserve forgiveness, even him. Are you so sure in yourself that you can deal out such final judgement?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder4            Catching your wife with another man is no excuse for what he did. 
adviser_deathrow_postmurder5            And he went there with a loaded gun, knowing he'd find them together. That's double pre-meditated murder.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder6            He's done nothing but co-operate with the authorities. This state is making an example of him. 
adviser_deathrow_postmurder7            If he'd committed his crime 100 miles north he'd be looking at life imprisonment instead. How is that justice?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder8            Do you want a guy like this running free? I'll sleep just fine at night when I know he's gone.
           

adviser_deathrowelectricity_1           Good work so far.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_2           However there is one problem - the execution room isn't functioning yet, because it doesn't have any power.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_3           We need to connect it to the electrical supply.

adviser_deathrowelectricityb_1          We are now viewing the prison in Utilities mode, which shows us the electrical wiring layout for the entire prison. 
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_2          Each building in the prison is connected to the Power Grid by these thick underground electrical cables.  
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_3          Power is provided to the prison by this substation, which draws electricity from the national grid.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4          As you can see, this entire wing of prison cells is without power.  All of the lights are out.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4b         To fix this problem, we first need to switch into Utilities mode to understand why the lights are without power.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_5          The nearest electrical cables are too far away - our engineers can't complete the wiring for this area.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_6          Extend the electrical cables nearby to cover this wing of the prison.

objective_deathrow_cellpower            Connect the rooms to the Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_connectchair_1         Lights aren't the only thing that needs power.  Your new Electric Chair does too.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_2         Use the Power Cables to connect the execution facility to the power grid.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_3         The Electric Chair itself is a special type of electrical item.  It requires its own dedicated power line. You'll need to connect it up directly with mains cables.

objective_deathrow_chairpower           Connect the Electric Chair to the Electrical Supply
objective_deathrow_condemnedcellpower   Connect the Cell to the Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_testchair_1            We are almost done I think.  We should test the new Execution room at least once before we try to use it though.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_2            I'm just going to turn it on for a few seconds, make sure everything is ok.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_3            Well, that didn't work.  Looks like we drew too much power, and tripped a circuit breaker in the power station.  The whole prison is dark.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_4            We're going to need more juice to be able to handle the power spike that the electric chair generates.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5            First, we need to turn the power back on.   This is a two step process:
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5b           Switch the power station back on by clicking on it, and selecting Switch On in the menu that appears.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_6            Then build three more capacitors so we have enough Power Capacity to handle the electric chair.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_7            Once you've done that, test the Electric chair again by clicking on it and selecting Switch On in the menu.

objective_deathrow_poweron              Turn the Power Station back on. (Click the power station, then select Switch On from the menu)
objective_deathrow_expandpower          Expand the power station with three new Capacitors
objective_deathrow_chairworking         Test the chair again (click on it, and select Switch On)

adviser_deathrow_execution_1            Well done.  I believe we are finished with this job.
adviser_deathrow_execution_2            What happens now is out of our hands.  We did a professional job, and that's important in our business.
adviser_deathrow_execution_3            Try not to worry about what happens next.  

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution1        It is time, Edward. 
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution2        You have done the right thing, even though this world will not forgive you for it.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution3        You will be with God soon, and He will have the final judgement on you.

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution4        Edward Romsey.  You have been found guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution5        The penalty is death.  
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution6        Do you have anything to say?
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution7        Susan...
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution8        I'm sorry.

event_bulkintake                        A disaster at a nearby prison has rendered a whole section of the facility unusable. We have no choice but to transfer the prisoners there to your prison, as there are no other suitable facilities nearby. They will be arriving soon.
event_workshopaccident                  A prisoner has been seriously wounded in a workshop accident, and can't be moved! Send a doctor, quickly!

event_virus_x                           We've been getting reports of sickness from a number of prisoners, and the symptoms seem quite severe. You should consider quarantining the sick and treating them before it spreads too far. 
event_treefire                          A fire has started in our forestry!
event_foodpoisoning                     We've been getting reports of food poisoning amongst the prisoners. Some of the food in the kitchen must have spoiled. Unfortunately for the sick, there isn't much to do but to wait it out.
event_cilistleak                        We don't know how, but the identities of our confidential informants have got out. If we don't move them somewhere save straight away, they are going to be in real danger.
event_keysersoze                        A recent high-profile gang case has implicated one of our Minimum Security prisoners as a high ranking gang leader. They've remained under the radar, but now everyone knows who they are...
event_preacherconversion                One of our more charismatic inmates has become something of a religious evangelist, and others seem to be coming around to their way of thinking. Not a necessarily a problem, but our prisoners may soon have more spiritual needs.

event_massassassination_1               The identities of a number of witnesses in a federal prosecution case have been leaked, and some of them are inmates in our prison.
event_massassassination_2               Hits have been taken out on them, but we need them alive. You need to identify the prisoners and keep them in one piece until their court date comes up.
event_massassassination_3_x             We're learning about this late, so you don't have much time before these hits go live. 

event_tvremovaldemand_1                 The media have started a campaign over the amenities granted to prisoners, and it's bringing a lot of heat on my office.
event_tvremovaldemand_2                 I'm passing a bill which bans TVs in common areas in prisons, so I need you to remove all TVs from your common rooms or you will be fined. You have 6 hours.
event_tvremovaldemand_fine              You've failed to remove TVs from your common rooms, which is now required by law. You've been fined, and will continue to receive fines until you comply. 
event_tvremovaldemand_complete          The media have moved on to something else and the bill banning TVs from common areas has been repealed. Feel free to re-install them if you wish.

event_weightsremovaldemand_1            The media have started a campaign over the amenities granted to prisoners, and it's brining a lot of heat on my office.
event_weightsremovaldemand_2            I'm passing a bill which bans exercise equipment in prison yards, so I need you to remove all Weights Benches from your Yards or you will be fined. You have 6 hours.
event_weightsremovaldemand_fine         You've failed to remove all Weights Benches from your yards, which is now required by law. You've been fined, and will continue to receive fines until you comply. 
event_weightsremovaldemand_complete     The media have moved on to something else and the bill banning weights benches from yards has been repealed. Feel free to re-install them if you wish.

event_lessfooddemand_1                  The board has decided to experiment with a number of cost-saving measures across our facilities, and your prison is being included.
event_lessfooddemand_2                  We need you to reduce the meal quantity and meal variation policies in your prison to low, so we can see what effect this has on overall budgets.
event_lessfooddemand_fine               Since you've decided not to implement the new food policies we've asked for, we're going to take the potential savings directly from your funds. This will continue to happen until you do as I've asked.
event_lessfooddemand_complete           The food budget experiment is over and the results are inconclusive. You are free to set your food policies back to whatever you wish.

event_removevisitationdemand_1          An incident at another facility has highlighted potential issues with security checks when it comes to family visitation in prisons.
event_removevisitationdemand_2          Until the processes can be properly reviewed, all visitation must be suspended. You have 12 hours to remove all Visitation rooms from your prison.
event_removevisitationdemand_fine       You have failed to remove the Visitation rooms from your prison, despite the current security issues. You've been fined, and will continue to be fined until you comply. 
event_removevisitationdemand_complete   We've completed our security review of the visitation process, and Visitation rooms can now be re-added to your prison if you choose. 

event_lessworkdemand_1                  I've just received word that the prisoners are unhappy with how much time they have to work during the day, and are planning to cause trouble if it isn't reduced.
event_lessworkdemand_2                  A guard overheard someone say that if they had to work for more than 2 hours they were going to "tear this place apart."
event_lessworkdemand_ignore             It looks like the prisoners have given up and settled down. They aren't happy about it, but it's good to show them who's boss around here.
event_lessworkdemand_complete           The prisoners have settled down about their work hours now - I guess they saw the last few days as something of a vacation. We can put them back to work without trouble.       

event_moresleepdemand_1                 We've received complaints that the prisoners aren't allowed to sleep enough, and are getting very irritable about it.
event_moresleepdemand_2                 They've said that if they aren't given at least 7 hours of sleep a night, they are going to start causing trouble. 
event_moresleepdemand_ignore            Looks like the prisoners have finally run out of steam and given up their protests about lack of sleep. Guess they were too tired.
event_moresleepdemand_complete          The whole issue with the prisoners' sleep schedules has finally blown over, so you can change them again without issue if you want.

event_morefreetimedemand_1              The prisoners are apparently unhappy with how little free time they have in their daily schedules.
event_morefreetimedemand_2              The guards have been hearing whispers that if things don't change soon, the prisoners are going to start causing some damage.
event_morefreetimedemand_ignore         The prisoners have settled down and stopped causing trouble over their lack of free time. Maybe they realised they'd have even less if they are always in solitary.
event_morefreetimedemand_complete       The prisoners demands for more free time have been indulged for long enough, so you can feel free to change their schedule again as you wish.

event_contrabandsurge_complete          We've just discovered that one of the teachers we bring in for the inmates classes has been smuggling in huge amounts of contraband. They've been fired, but the damage has been done at this point.
event_corruptingspiritualist_complete	One of the spiritual leaders we bring in for our religious programs has been riling up the inmates with all kinds of hateful speech. They've been fired, but the prisoners will take some time to cool down.

event_agitatingradio_1                  According to some of our Guards, a new radio host on the station the prisoners listen to has been saying a lot of things that are riling the inmates up.
event_agitatingradio_2                  It might be worth removing the radios for the time being, unless they start to take what he's saying seriously.
event_agitatingradio_complete           That radio host was apparently fired after a lot of complaints. There shouldn't be any more problems with radios in the prison.
